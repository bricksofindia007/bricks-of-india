# BOI Master Tracker

> **Purpose:** One-page index of phase status, blockers, and deadlines. Task-level detail lives in the four sub-trackers below.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-05-01 (LAB-01 shipped to production)
> **Audit log:** `audit-block1.log`

## Auto-update protocol

**Source of truth hierarchy:** `BOI_MASTER_TRACKER.md` is the canonical source of truth.
`admin/dashboard.html` is a rendered view of the tracker. If the two ever conflict,
the tracker wins and the dashboard must be reconciled to match.

**Atomic update rule:** Any change to project state — bug closed, fix deployed, pipeline
status moved, audit run, KPI changed, new tool added, cadence modified — MUST update
both files in the same commit. Never one without the other.

**Triggering events that require dashboard update:**
1. A bug is closed (update `issues[].status` → `closed`, set `deployedOn`)
2. A new bug is filed (add to `issues[]` with next BUG-NNN ID)
3. A pipeline item changes status (update `pipeline[].status`)
4. A new pipeline item is created (add to `pipeline[]`)
5. A dependency is satisfied (update `pipeline[].depsBlock` and re-evaluate `blocked` items)
6. A deploy happens (update `kpis.lastDeployDate`, recompute `daysSinceLastDeploy`)
7. Netlify minutes change materially (update `kpis.netlifyMinutesLeft`)
8. An audit is run (update `kpis.lastAuditDate`, `kpis.nextAuditDate`, and relevant
   `auditChecklist[].items[].status`)
9. A new tool/API is integrated (add to `stack[]`)
10. A cron schedule is added or changed (update `cadence[]`)
11. The GEO score is re-measured (update `kpis.geoScore`)
12. The voice test resolves (update `kpis.voiceTestStatus`)

**Workflow at task end:**
Before declaring any task complete, run this checklist:
- [ ] Did this task close a bug? → update `issues[]` in dashboard
- [ ] Did this task move a pipeline item? → update `pipeline[]` in dashboard
- [ ] Did this task deploy code? → update `kpis.lastDeployDate`
- [ ] Did this task change anything in the tracker's "Top of mind" section? → reconcile
- [ ] Run JSON validation on the dashboard
- [ ] Stage both files together: `git add BOI_MASTER_TRACKER.md admin/dashboard.html`
- [ ] Commit with a message that names what changed

**Health score recomputation:**
After any update, recompute `kpis.healthScore` (0–100) using this rough formula:
- Start at 100
- Subtract 20 per open P0 issue
- Subtract 10 per open P1 issue
- Subtract 5 if Netlify minutes < 100
- Subtract 5 if last audit > 30 days ago or never run
- Subtract 5 if voice test still pending after 14 days
- Subtract 5 if GEO score < 50
- Subtract 5 if any blocked pipeline item is P0 or P1
- Floor at 0, ceiling at 100
Then update `kpis.healthScoreNote` to a one-line summary of the dominant factor.

**Session start:**
At the start of every session, after reading the tracker, also verify the dashboard
JSON parses. If it doesn't, fix before doing anything else.

## Infrastructure status

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| DNS authority | ✅ Confirmed | Cloudflare (kira.ns.cloudflare.com, yadiel.ns.cloudflare.com). Origin: Netlify. Email MX: ImprovMX (unchanged). |
| Netlify → GitHub Actions migration | ✅ Done | Commit `8992aef` + `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |
| Scraper workflow on GitHub Actions | ✅ Running | `scrape-prices.yml` + 492 rows scraped today |
| GEO/AI readiness (llms.txt, sitemap, JSON-LD) | ✅ Live | All 200, schemas present |
| Supabase (store_prices, price_history) | ✅ Healthy | 492 current rows, 9,142 historical |
| Site integrity | ✅ All 200 | `/sets` fixed (SETS-01, commit `20474c2`). All core pages healthy. |
| Catalogue sync (sets table) | ✅ Scheduled | `sync-catalogue.yml` weekly Sun 02:00 UTC. ~26k Rebrickable entries → ~10k unique rows after dedup. 16,888 rows, 99.4% image coverage. Assertion threshold: ≥ 8,000 rows. |

## Current blockers (top 3)

1. **Voice Codex not started** — blocks WEB-01→04 lint gate pipeline, blocks Phase 2 Claude Project workbench, blocks all content automation.
2. **Review + Product JSON-LD missing** on `/reviews` and `/sets` — GEO regression from Deploy 2.
3. **DATA-01 open** — `store_prices` (scraper writes) ↔ `prices` (frontend reads) disconnected; live scraper data not reaching `/compare`.

## Carry-overs

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| CATALOG-04 v2 | USD MSRP ingest from Brickset + INR derivation | 🔴 Not fired | Brief at `briefs/CATALOG-04-v2.md`. Next in queue after this tracker update. |
| CATALOG-05 | Theme backfill — older sets missing from theme pages | 🔴 Not started | Depends on full sync completing all 27 pages (Rebrickable daily quota currently limits one-shot runs). |
| DATA-01 | Reconcile `store_prices` (scraper) ↔ `prices` (frontend) | 🔴 Not started | Tracked in `BOI_WEB_TRACKER.md` Section H. 2–3 hours. Schedule after CATALOG-04. |

## THE LAB — 1 of 6 live

Experimental features. Each ships as a standalone page under `/lab/`. Brief files live in `briefs/`.

| ID | Name | Status | Depends on | Brief |
|----|------|--------|------------|-------|
| LAB-01 | Biryani Index | ✅ Live | — | `briefs/LAB-01-biryani-index.md` |
| LAB-02 | Which Set Are You? (quiz) | 🔴 Not fired | LAB-01 | `briefs/LAB-02-which-set-quiz.md` |
| LAB-03 | Daily price snapshot cron | 🔴 Not fired | — | `briefs/LAB-03-price-snapshot-cron.md` |
| LAB-04 | Lab homepage strip + nav + /lab directory | 🔴 Not fired | LAB-01, ideally LAB-02 | `briefs/LAB-04-homepage-strip.md` |
| LAB-05 | Price Drop Board | 🔴 Deferred | LAB-03 + 30 days of snapshot data | — |
| LAB-06 | Retirement Radar | 🔴 Deferred | CATALOG-04 v2 (Brickset cron) | — |
| LAB-07 | LEGO Heat Map | 🔴 Deferred | Google Trends API integration | — |
| LAB-08 | Brick Portfolio | 🔴 Deferred indefinitely | Auth strategy decision | — |

**Decisions made:**

- **User accounts — DEFERRED.** 5 of 6 Lab tools require no auth. Only Portfolio (LAB-08) needs it. Email capture also deferred — DPDP Act compliance overhead not justified without proven editorial cadence for a list. Revisit when LAB-08 is being scoped.
